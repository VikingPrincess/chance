chance
======


Recently i found javascript generator  called [chance](http://chancejs.com/) written by  [Victor Quinn](http://victorquinn.com/). I liked it a lot and found it quite useful for programms testing or filling something with dump data. I could't find anything similar for python so i decided to write it on my own, using chance.js implementation as a guide.
